# Introduction

This is a REST API project built with Nodejs/Express concerning user profiles made up of ~~Malaysian~~ different nationals. This is still a work in progress.

The technologies used will be:

1. Node JS
2. Express
3. PostgreSQL

The end goal is to serve fake data for developers to play around with. I would like to allow developers to add new data to the database, but to ensure the datasets don't get too bloated over time, I might have a cron job that runs every x days that clears out those data. We'll see!
